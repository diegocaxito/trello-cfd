Trello Cumulative Flow Diagrams
==========

The Trello Cumulative Flow Diagrams website (http://trello-cfd.azurewebsites.net) builds CFDs based on a Trello board. For a more detailed introduction see the website or this blog post: http://www.rhysgodfrey.co.uk/archive/2013/01/02/cumulative-flow-diagrams-cfd-for-trello.aspx.

If there is a new feature you'd like to add, or would like to help with any of the suggested enhancements (https://github.com/rhysgodfrey/trello-cfd/issues) please go ahead and submit a pull request!

Setup
------

Getting the project up and running should be pretty straight forward, you will need to enter your Trello API credentials in the Trello.config file in the root of the website.

You can generate an API key by visiting: https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate

Please do not commit changes to the Trello.config file for security reasons.

Chello
------

The project makes use of the Chello project (https://bitbucket.org/mrshrinkray/chello) to access the Trello API. A slightly modified fork of this project is in use which can be found at: https://bitbucket.org/rhysgodfrey/chello
